    <h1>Learn module for co-coproduction DB</h1>
    <p>The document has two parts. In the first part, questions are based on the columns that we already have in the co-production database. The wordings are not precise and need editing. The answers should appear in the form of drop-down boxes or alternative options for user to choose.</p>
    <p>In the second part, some extra questions are suggested. Note that for these questions to be viable, new columns need to be added to the DB spreadsheet, hence a little bit of extra effort!</p>
    <p>Introduction Summarising and describing categories (Use the Van Notten headings and compare with Figure 1 of Kasper-Henrik paper).</p>
    <p>This database is aimed for users who haven`t been exposed with scenario development. We provide a simple set of introduction and guiding questions of what methods, techniques and methodologies can do. From main questions relating to project goal and scenario knowledge generation.</p>
    <h3>Terminology for scenarios focussed on “What can happen?”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For quantitative model-based scenario approaches, often deployed on the national to global scale, the term ‘projection’ is frequently used to refer to scenarios that address what can happen, for example in ‘climate impact projections’ or ‘baseline projections’. We suggest to use this term in instances, where the quantitative part dominates the scenario content, even if underpinned by a secondary narrative element.</li>
      <li>For regional scenario approaches, the term ‘explorative scenario’ is commonly used. Here the term ‘projection’ is restricted to model-based, quantitative elements of explorative scenarios which are based on the qualitative narrative elements at their core.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Terminology for scenarios focussed on “What should happen?”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In many cases, e.g. in quantitative scenario applications on the national to global scale, scenarios that address what should happen are referred to as ‘goal-oriented scenarios’ or pathways.</li>
      <li>In other, more often regional, scenario applications, the common term is ‘normative scenario’. At regional level there is a clear and strong dichotomy between exploring what can happen and designing what should happen, mostly reinforced by a difference in scale with normative scenarios being developed for smaller regions and shorter time horizons, also building on different methods and tools. The explorative scenarios are built for opening up the imagination amongst stakeholders on what can happen, while the normative scenarios are built after the explorative ones in order to cope with challenges. For model-based scenario approaches, both types of scenarios are more intertwined and often are developed with the same (modelling) tools.</li>
